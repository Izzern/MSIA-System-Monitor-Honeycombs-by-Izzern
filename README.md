MSIA SYSTEM MONITOR HONEYCOMB BY IZZERN
<br>

These skins were designed to be a simple and easily customizable
system monitor. As such they require very little setup by the
user and the look can be adjusted using the GUI.
<br>

This window automatically retrieves and writes hardware
specifications to @Resources\Variables.inc when started or
refreshed.
<br><br>

CUSTOMIZATION
<br>

To customize the look of Izzern's System Monitor Honeycombs use
the GUI by clicking on one of the icons (CPU, GPU, RAM, FPS,
or Wifi percentage). 
<br>

Within the GUI is a button to restore defaults and the icons
also display information about the device(s) being monitored. 
<br>

Changes to the layout of the Honeycomb may be neccessary with
changes to font and scale. This can be done in the skin file
(i.e. System Monitor Honeycomb by Izzern\cpu usage\cpu MSIA.ini).
<br><br>

MSI AFTERBURNER
<br><br>
I have included the plugin for MSI Afterburner (MSIA) in the
RMSkin and links to MSIA and the plugin below. 
You must install MSIA (and Riva Statistics Tuner for FPS only)
to use these skins.
<br>

If you have multiple GPUs it may be neccessary to use the
"GPU1", "GPU2", "VRAMProc1", etc. variants.
